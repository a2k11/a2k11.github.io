I'm Adam, originally from Jamsion in Bucks County PA which is about 20 miles outside of Philadelphia.  I've been living for the past 5 years in Lexington, KY working as a software engineer.  I've spent time developing ruby & rails applications, gaining aws / devops experience using docker & kubernetes, creating python & flask applications, and tinkering with some JavaScript & React.  I'm passionate about cooking healthy and exercise.  I play volleyball almost every week and I try to be outdoors as much as possible.  Mega Man is one my favorite games so that's why you see Mega Man as my avatar in several places.  I enjoy  video & board games with friends.
