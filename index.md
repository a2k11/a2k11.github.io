I'm Adam, originally from Jamsion in Bucks County PA which is close to Philly.  I've been living for the past 5 years in Lexington, KY working as a software engineer.  I've spent time developing ruby & rails applications, gaining aws / devops experience using docker & kubernetes, creating python & flask applications, and looking more at frontend frameworks such as React.  I'm passionate about cooking healthy and exercise.  I play volleyball almost every week and try to be outdoors as much as possible.  Mega Man 2 is my favorite game so that's why you see Mega Man as my avatar in several places.  I enjoy video & board games when I have the time.
